    It may help to <strong>realize</strong> that both are valid and semantic elements in HTML5 and that it's a coincidence that they both have the same default styling (boldface) in most browsers (although some older browsers actually underline
    strong).
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's write italicize HTML MDN. And you can see that there's actually two tags that come up here and the first one that comes up is this one. So let's have a look at it first.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now this is the <strong>em</strong> or the emphasis element and it marks text that has a stress emphasis. Now it looks like this in practice and the result is that it makes it look <em>italicized</em>. Now you might have noticed back here, we
    also had the <em>i</em> element or the i tag and it does the same thing visually. It also makes the text that's in between the i tags italicized. But there's a little bit of a difference here and the difference is quite subtle. The emphasis tag
    tells the browser the words that are enclosed between it should be <em>stressed</em> or should be emphasized, but the <em>i</em> tag only italicizes the text. So it only styles the text to make it <em>slanted</em> and it doesn't confer any of
    that emphasis.
  </p>
  <p>
    And for this reason, it's good practice to always use emphasis instead of italic because it <strong>conveys more information and it isn't just about the style. Remember when we're writing HTML code we're more concerned about structuring our text
      rather than caring about how it looks or how it appears</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now a similar pair is the <code>B tag</code> or the bold tag, and this is equivalent to the i tag. It makes any texts that's in between bolded like so. But instead, what you should be using is the strong tag. And that's because the strong tag,
    again, confers <strong>meaning</strong>. It says that this text has strong importance and therefore it's displayed in bold rather than merely saying that this should be styled so that it's darker than the rest of the text.
